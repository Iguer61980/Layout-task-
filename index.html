                <p> Hello! My name is Isabella Guerrero, and this portfolio showcases my experience with coding and collaboration on various programming projects. 
                    I am majoring in Secondary Education, and I am passionate about integrating technology and coding into the classroom.
                My goal is to create engaging lessons and presentations that help students connect with digital literacy and problem-solving in meaningful ways.
                I also enjoy designing my own instructional materials to enhance the learning experience. 
        </p>

                    <h3>Mistery Shack Website</h3>
                    <p> This project is about creating a website for the Mystery Shack in Gravity Falls. Mystery Shack is the store own by Stan where he would sell 
                        strange and mysterious merchandise from Gravity Falls mysteries. I worked on this website along Kara StJohn and Sofia Gomez, I was the one 
                        in charge of developing the CSS homepage part of the website, and adding on to the CSS along my collaborators. The website takes inspiration 
                        from the Mystery Shack and the lore of Gravity Falls. We decided to add three pages to the website: Homepage, Meet the Staff, and a Mystery 
                        Shack Gift Shop. The tone of the website leans into tourist-trap/cabin in the woods vibe. Intentionally chaotic and all over the place with a
                        silly, mysterious tone as well.</p>
