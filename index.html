                <p> Hello! My name is Isabella Guerrero, and this portfolio showcases my experience with coding and collaboration on various programming projects. 
                    I am majoring in Secondary Education, and I am passionate about integrating technology and coding into the classroom.
                My goal is to create engaging lessons and presentations that help students connect with digital literacy and problem-solving in meaningful ways.
                I also enjoy designing my own instructional materials to enhance the learning experience. 
        </p>

                    <h3>Mistery Shack Website</h3>
                    <p> This project is about creating a website for the Mystery Shack in "Gravity Falls". Mystery Shack is the store owned by Stan, where he sells
                        strange and mysterious merchandise from "Gravity Falls" mysteries. I worked on this website along with Kara StJohn and Sofia Gomez. I was the one 
                        in charge of developing the homepage part of the website, which meant doing the HTML and CSS for that page, as well as helping with CSS in other pages with my collaborators. The website takes inspiration 
                        from the Mystery Shack and the lore of Gravity Falls. We decided to add three pages to the website: Homepage, Meet the Staff, and a Mystery 
                        Shack Gift Shop. The tone of the website leans into tourist-trap/cabin in the woods vibe. Intentionally chaotic and all over the place with a
                        silly, mysterious tone as well.</p>

                    <h3>Saiki K Website</h3>
                    <p> I developed this website as if Saiki K from “The Disastrous Life of Saiki K” was the one in charge of creating it. It has inside jokes that only people 
                        who have watched the anime know about. The website includes HTML, CSS for style, and a folder with the pictures used. The tone of the website leans into 
                        the sarcastic personality of Saiki K by adding phrases that he would most likely say. The website also has hidden messages or easter eggs talking about 
                        his psychic powers (the whole premise of the anime is that he hides away his psychic powers from everyone else).  </p>
